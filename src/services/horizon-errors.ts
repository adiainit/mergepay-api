/**
 * Translation layer for Stellar Horizon failures — issue #810.
 *
 * `@stellar/stellar-sdk` throws errors whose useful information lives two
 * levels deep: an HTTP `response.data.extras.result_codes` object and a
 * base64 `result_xdr` describing the ledger's verdict. Neither is safe or
 * readable to hand to a client verbatim, and the generic `PROVIDER_REJECTED`
 * answer ("the upstream said no") does not tell a wallet what to do next.
 *
 * This module reduces both shapes to a small, allow-listed vocabulary of
 * result-code tokens and maps the common ones onto a stable API code, an HTTP
 * status, and an actionable hint. Anything unrecognized still becomes
 * `PROVIDER_REJECTED`, but only the validated result-code tokens survive — the
 * raw payload, operation details, and upstream message text never do.
